/** Find the Largest element in an array......
  
Solution1: Sorting
  
Intuition:
We can sort the array in ascending order, hence the largest element will be at the last index of the array. 

Approach: 
Sort the array in ascending order.
Print the (size of the array -1)th index.
DryRun: 
Before sorting: arr[] = {2,5,1,3,0};

After sorting: arr[] = {0,1,2,3,5};

Hence answer : arr[sizeofthearray-1] =5
